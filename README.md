# Price Review (Website)

# Product Vision

For all retail consumers, this product is intended to allow buyers to make informed decisions on 
purchases, by having the most up to date information on restocks, prices and overall quality. 
The product goes by the name Price Review , which is used through a website that is easily accessible
by consumers which leads to a large target audience that can benefit both businesses and buyers. 
Unlike normal sites like Amazon, where reviews for products aren't that integral to their platform 
to allow users to have the best information before receiving the product as sometimes the reviews
are vague, or also biased since there are reports that amazon 3rd party sellers sometimes 
pay for reviews to be 5 star as a way to beat the algorithm rankings. 
Our product offers a complete way to view every aspect of a product unbiasedly that is in hot demand,
and allows consumers to chat with one another.

# Sprint 1

Each item should link to the actual product, be it a google spreadsheet, google doc, github markdown file, etc. Do not link to a markdown file that contains only a link to another location - link directly from the appropriate item below. Failure to adhere to this criteria wil result in the associated artifact not being graded. Add any additional items required for the specific sprint submission.

## Task Allocation

Member 1 - main tasking

Member 2 - main tasking

In this section, each group member needs to provide a brief description of what they worked on during the sprint. Keep this short and to the point. Your trello board and commit history will provide the details. 

**note**: For this first sprint, I am anticipating that you will have selected one or two user stories for the Sprint Backlog, and most likely not have completed them since the majority if this week will consist of getting your product backlog, requirements, and development environment fleshed out and stood up. The only implementation I am expecting to see is that your development environment is properly configured to where it can at least run a basic "hello world" type application. 
- For this week we got together this week and we set up the work envirment for the team. Also we made changes to the trello as a group to set out an outline of the tasks we are going to accomplish.
